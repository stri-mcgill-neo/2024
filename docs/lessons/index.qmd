Welcome to the Data Curation/R Markdown module of the STRI-McGill Neotropical field course. This module is meant as a complement for the rest of the curriculum and our main goals here are to: **a**)  **create interactive, data-driven, web products** that capture analytical workflows, raw data, and data outputs; and **b**) give you the tools, motivation, and inspiration to make your science more **accessible**, **transparent**, and **reproducible**.

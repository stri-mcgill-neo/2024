There is no universal convention that I am aware of but you can save yourself a lot of trouble by following a few simple rules when naming files and directories.\n\n::: aside\nEstimated reading time: 2 minute(s).\n:::\n\n\n> Your task is to ensure your files are **Machine readable** and **Human readable**.\n\n**Never** use special characters in your file name (e.g., `* # : \\ / < > | \" ? [ ] ; = + & Â£ $`,  and so on). Letters and numbers **only**. Many of these symbols are prohibited and a lot of software will reject files that contain these symbols. \n\nPeriods `.` should only be used for a file extension, like `document.html`. If you put a period `.` at the beginning of a file or directory name, like `.bash_profile`, then it will be hidden by default. Do not do this at the beginning of a name unless you know what you are doing :) \n\n**Do not** use spaces. Separate words using a dash (`-`) or an underscore (`_`), like `how-to-use-this-site.Rmd`. You can also use camel case if you prefer, like `howToUseThisSite.Rmd`.\n\nThe file name should be short but meaningful. This is important when dealing with a lot of files, like for a website. So add relevant details but keep it less than 25 characters---long file names mean long URLs, which can increase the likelihood of errors.. \n\nIf you include a date in the name, use date format [ISO_8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) `YYYY-MM-DD` or `YYYYMMDD`. Distill blog sites use `YYYY-MM-DD` by default. \n\nYou can begin a file/directory name with a number, just be sure to use sequential numbering like `01_File`, `02_Stuff`, etc. instead of `1_File` and `2_Stuff`.\n\nWhatever approach you choose, I think the main key is to be consistent. If you use dashes `-` to separate words in a name, then try to stick with that for everything.  \n\n## Credits {.appendix}\n\nThe feature photo for this post---[A small amateur insect collection by](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Small-insect-collection.jpg) [Debivort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Debivort) at the English-language Wikipedia---was retrieved from Wikimedia Commons and Licensed under [CC BY-SA 3.0](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/).
